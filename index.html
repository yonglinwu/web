<h2>First off, why should I care?</h2>
	<p> Having the right gaming mouse can be the difference between hitting and missing most of your shots. 
      A good, ergonomic mouse can also help relieve wrist pain that may come with playing fast-paced FPS games such as Overwatch or CSGO, or even just doing your daily work.
	  Recently, there's also been an increasing interest in high quality wireless gaming mouse, and even the after-market customization of them. 
	  As we shift to spending more and more time on the computer, it only makes sense to invest in a higher quality mouse to make your life just a bit easier. 
	</p>
	  
<h2>What makes a good gaming mouse?</h2>
	<p> The first priority when considering what makes a good gaming mouse is not necessarily "what is the best mouse," but rather "what is it that you are looking for in a mouse?"
      If you're like me, and prefer to use wireless mice, then the options are much more limited. 
	  Even though the production and number of models of high-end wireless mice have significantly increased over the past few years, 
	  there are still countless more wired mice than wireless, due to just how new high-speed wireless mouse tech is. <br>
	  
	  The main characteristic you should focus on when purchasing a good mouse is the shape. Nowadays, the difference between wireless and wired, along with weight, is so miniscule, that shape is now the true determining factor.
	  The two main options are as follows:

	  <h3> Ambidextrous/Symmetrical </h3>
		<p> Ambidextrous mice are essentially one-size-fits-all mice. They have a symmetrical design to them, and as a result, can be used by both left and right handed people. 
			Many ambidextrous mice have become the most popular FPS gaming mice, as their shape demands a tighter grip that is more focused on your fingers, but rewards the user with greater and faster control. 
			Ambidextrous mice are great for fast flicking and holding your crosshair at a specific position. 
			For that reason, as well as the universal design, many peripheral companies have opted to design their flagship mice as ambidextrous, for  higher performance, flexibility, and sales.
		</p>
			
	  <h3> Ergonomic/Asymmetrical </h3>
		<p> Ergonomic mice are, as the name suggests, ergonomic. They are asymmetrical by design, and commonly exclusively for right handed users, although there are some high-end ergonomic mice that do come in a left handed shape. 
			The benefit of an ergonomic mouse is that it's more comfortable, and often "molds" to the shape of your hand. This also puts more emphasis on the palm when gripping, as opposed to ambidextrous mice. 
			Some extremely ergonomic mice are specifically designed for work, rather than gaming, although some would argue that they're a little too unusual for any other use. 
			Fewer and fewer companies these days seem to want to sell ergonomic mice as their flagships, however there are still plently of options.

<h2>Recommendations? Reputable brands?</h2>
	<p> When browsing through online marketplaces such as Amazon, it's very easy to get misled as to what brands are trustworthy and create the best quality mice.
	So here are 3 recommendations of both brands and specific mice to look into. 
	
	<h3>Logitech</h3>
		<p>I've been a long time supporter of Logitech and their products, because time after time, their peripherals impress me with their high quality and usually reasonable prices.
		Noteworthy among their mice are the Logitech G Pro Wireless and the recently released upgrade, the Logitech G Pro X Superlight. Both these mice are what I would consider to be the gold standard among mice.
		Great wireless performance, low weight at around 80g and 63g respectively, and with an ambidextrous shape and subtle curvature, these mice are not only of the highest quality, but also built for competition.
		There's a reason why so many esports pros are using this exact mouse. However, the downside is the high price tag, at $100 and $150 respectively, but it's definitely worth your money. 
		My main mouse is the G Pro, and it's served me well for over 3 years. 
		</p>
		
	<h3>Razer</h3>
		<p>Razer have really stepped up their mouse game recently with the Razer Viper Ultimate. It's very similar to the G Pro in both price and performance, with subtle differences.
		It has a lower back hump, deeper left and right mouse button grooves, and even comes with a wireless charger. Notably, it also uses optical switches for its buttons, as opposed to standard mechanical switches.
		These make the buttons more accurate and essentially eliminate the possiblilty of a double-click. If you're not into the G Pro, this mouse is a great option as well.
		</p>
		
	<h3>Glorious</h3>
		<p>For a slighly cheaper option, coming in at around $87, is the Glorious Model O Wireless. Arguably just as good, if not better than the mice I've already listed above, it's in real contention to be the best overall gaming mouse. 
		However, it does use a honeycomb design, meaning the main body of the mouse is covered in holes to reduce the overall weight of the mouse. 
		If you have trypophobia, or you're just not into the holes, I don't recommend this mouse unless you purchase it with the 1st-party grip tape that will help cover up most of the holes. 
		It has a similar shape to the Viper Ultimate, but is noticably larger.

<h2>Additional Resources</h2>
		<p>When I want to learn more about the specifics of high-end gaming mouse, I go to <a href="https://www.rocketjumpninja.com">Rocket Jump Ninja</a> His website has boundless information on gaming mice, and he is a known reviewer of gaming mice. 
		He also has a youtube channel under the name Rocket Jump Ninja, and I highly recommend checking it out if you're interested.<br>
		I also recommend the review channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHU2VaRKaxqDnjP3spyD0KQ">The Techne</a>. Personally, I think he's extremely underrated as a mouse reviewer, and as a peripheral reviewer in general.
